I used the following resources for this project:

1. Google Developers Web Fundamentals (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance), including the following topics:

	a. Render Blocking CSS

2. Google to understand what above-the-fold content is and how you figure out what is included (stackoverflow was the most useful here).
