I used the following resources for this project:

1. Google Developers Web Fundamentals (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance), including the following topics:

	a. Render Blocking CSS
	b. https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery
	c. https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-css-inline-google-fonts

2. Google to understand what above-the-fold content is and how you figure out what is included (stackoverflow was the most useful here).

3. Udacity forums (didn't always find much help here, but I try to always check).
