I used the following resources for this project:

1. Google Developers Web Fundamentals (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance), including the following topics:

	a. Render Blocking CSS
	b. https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery
	c. https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-css-inline-google-fonts

2. Google to understand what above-the-fold content is and how you figure out what is included (stackoverflow was the most useful here).

3. Udacity forums (didn't always find much help here, but I try to always check).

4. Googled for resources on optimizing for scroll rate. Found the following sites helpful:

	a. http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/scrolling/
	b. http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html
